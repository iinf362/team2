<p><strong>Leases - Renting an Apartment</strong> 
When a tenant is looking for an apartment to rent, a potential landlord cannot refuse to rent that apartment to the tenant on the basis of his or her race, religion, color, national origin, sex, disability, or marital status. The landlord also cannot charge more than he or she would, or impose other conditions on the tenancy, because a particular tenant or the tenant's family on these grounds. This section will review some of these protections, as well as others, that protect a tenant when he or she is looking to rent an apartment.

<h2>Right Against Discrimination by Landlord or the Landlord's Agent</h2>
<p>A landlord cannot refuse to rent or discriminate against potential renters due to the renter's race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, or marital status. Whether the landlord or someone working for the landlord discriminates against you does not matter: it's still discrimination covered by the law. There are a limited number of buildings where these protections do not apply, however. For example, these protections do not apply to two-family homes where the owner of the building resides in one of the apartments in the home, to buildings where all of the rooms are rented to members of the same sex, the renting of a room in an apartment where the owner of the apartment also lives in the same apartment, to restrictions on sales or rental of housing where those restrictions prevent the sale of apartments to people exclusively over the age of 65, or to apartments where the residents are all 55 or older.

<h2>Right to Nondiscrimination for Tenants with Children</h2>
<p>A landlord who refuses to rent any or part of any residential premises solely on ground prospective tenant has children is subject to criminal and civil liability. There are exceptions to these limits as well. Apartments that are federally subsidized senior citizen housing, owner-occupied one- or two-family homes, or trailer parks for persons 55 or over. In addition, any rental lease that provides during a lease term that the tenant shall not bear children is a violation of the law.</p>
